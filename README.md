# Part I 
Step 1: Training  
Apply the Decision Tree model on the two data sets respectively.  
Apply the K-NN model on the two data sets respectively.
Apply the Naive Bayes model on the two data sets respectively.
(Note: Please divide the dataset into a training set with 80% data and a test set with 20% data)
Step 2: Evaluating
Based on the first step, we can get six training models. Use Confusion Matrix to evaluate these six models and analyze their pros and cons.
Step 3: Comparing
Horizontal comparison: Compare the performance of the same training model on different data sets.
Longitudinal comparison: Compare the performance of different training models on the same data set.
